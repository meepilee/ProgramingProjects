"Hardman" by Brannon Lai and Everett Syroid
Brannon - Did most of the coding
Everett - Did most of the graphics
This is an hangman clone coded in c++ using only methods. The player gets 7 lives but every time the player loses lives an random number generator will take over and start randomly picking letters until it loses a life and the control of the game moves back to the player.
